This is a project where I will be using COVID19 data from both the government 
of Alberta and government of Canada to make figures. These figures will 
indicate various covid statistics based on numerous factors. The Alberta data 
is inserted into a database where it will later be extracted to create such
visuals. The Canada data will directly be extracted from the data set to create
visuals.
